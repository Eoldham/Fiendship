# Fiendship

## Concept: 
Help an elephant fight off leaping vegetables as you collect flowers and travel through different levels. 

## About: 
This game is a procedurally generated set of 20 rooms. 
The player is an elephant who moves up down left and right. 
The player collects flowers which can be used to purchase health. 
The enemies are leaping vegetables that when the elephant bumps into engage in battle. 
Battle consists of the players attack where they pick one of three flowers which will decide how hard they hit. 
Then the vegetable gets a chance to attack, if the player guesses a letter close enough to the vegetables favorite letter
they won't get hurt.
